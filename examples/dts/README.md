# Examples

This directory contains examples of how to author durable orchestrations using the Durable Task Python SDK in conjunction with the Durable Task Scheduler (DTS). Please note that the installation instructions provided below will use the version of DTS directly from the your branch rather than installing through PyPI.

## Prerequisites

All the examples assume that you have a Durable Task Scheduler taskhub created.

The simplest way to create a taskhub is by using the az cli commands:

1. Create a scheduler:
    az durabletask scheduler create --resource-group <testrg> --name <testscheduler> --location <eastus> --ip-allowlist "[0.0.0.0/0]" --sku-capacity 1 --sku-name "Dedicated" --tags "{}"

1. Create your taskhub

    ```bash
    az durabletask taskhub create --resource-group <testrg> --scheduler-name <testscheduler> --name <testtaskhub>
    ```

1. Retrieve the endpoint for the scheduler. This can be done by locating the taskhub in the portal.

1. Set the appropriate environment variables for the TASKHUB and ENDPOINT

    ```bash
    export TASKHUB=<taskhubname>
    export ENDPOINT=<taskhubEndpoint>
    ```

1. Since the samples rely on azure identity, ensure the package is installed and up-to-date

    ```bash
    python3 -m pip install azure-identity
    ```

1. Install the correct packages from the top level of this repository, i.e. durabletask-python/

    ```bash
    python3 -m pip install .
    ```

1. Install the DTS specific packages from the durabletask-python/durabletask-azuremanaged directory

    ```bash
    pip3 install -e .
    ```

1. Grant yourself the `Durable Task Data Contributor` role over your scheduler

## Running the examples

Now, you can simply execute any of the examples in this directory using `python3`:

```sh
python3 dts_activity_sequence.py
```
