# Portable SDK Sample for Sub Orchestrations and Fan-out / Fan-in

This sample demonstrates how to use the Durable Task SDK, also known as the Portable SDK, with the Durable Task Scheduler to create orchestrations. These orchestrations not only spin off child orchestrations but also perform parallel processing by leveraging the fan-out/fan-in application pattern.

The scenario showcases an order processing system where orders are processed in batches.

## Running the Examples
There are two separate ways to run an example:

- Using the Emulator
- Using a deployed Scheduler and Taskhub

### Running with a Deployed Scheduler and Taskhub rResource
1. To create a taskhub, follow these steps using the Azure CLI commands:

Create a Scheduler:
```bash
az durabletask scheduler create --resource-group --name --location --ip-allowlist "[0.0.0.0/0]" --sku-capacity 1 --sku-name "Dedicated" --tags "{'myattribute':'myvalue'}"
```

Create Your Taskhub:
```bash
az durabletask taskhub create --resource-group <testrg> --scheduler-name <testscheduler> --name <testtaskhub>
```

2. Retrieve the Endpoint for the Scheduler: Locate the taskhub in the Azure portal to find the endpoint.

3. Set the Environment Variables:
Bash:
```bash
export TASKHUB=<taskhubname>
export ENDPOINT=<taskhubEndpoint>
```
Powershell:
```powershell
$env:TASKHUB = "<taskhubname>"
$env:ENDPOINT = "<taskhubEndpoint>"
```

4. Install the Correct Packages
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Grant your developer credentials the `Durable Task Data Contributor` Role.

### Running with the Emulator
The emulator simulates a scheduler and taskhub, packaged into an easy-to-use Docker container. For these steps, it is assumed that you are using port 8080.

1. Install Docker: If it is not already installed.

2. Pull the Docker Image for the Emulator:
```bash
docker pull mcr.microsoft.com/dts/dts-emulator:v0.0.6
```

3. Run the Emulator: Wait a few seconds for the container to be ready.
```bash
docker run --name dtsemulator -d -p 8080:8080 mcr.microsoft.com/dts/dts-emulator:v0.0.4
```

3. Set the Environment Variables:
Bash:
```bash
export TASKHUB=<taskhubname>
export ENDPOINT=<taskhubEndpoint>
```
Powershell:
```powershell
$env:TASKHUB = "<taskhubname>"
$env:ENDPOINT = "<taskhubEndpoint>"
```

4. Edit the Examples: Change the token_credential input of both the `DurableTaskSchedulerWorker` and `DurableTaskSchedulerClient` to `None`.

### Running the Examples
You can now execute the sample using Python:

Start the worker and ensure the TASKHUB and ENDPOINT environment variables are set in your shell:
```bash 
python3 ./worker.py
```

Next, start the orchestrator and make sure the TASKHUB and ENDPOINT environment variables are set in your shell:
```bash
python3 ./orchestrator.py
```

You should start seeing logs for processing orders in both shell outputs.

### Review Orchestration History and Status in the Durable Task Scheduler Dashboard
To access the Durable Task Scheduler Dashboard, follow these steps:

- **Using the Emulator**: By default, the dashboard runs on portal 8082. Navigate to http://localhost:8082 and click on the default task hub.

- **Using a Deployed Scheduler**: Navigate to the Scheduler resource. Then, go to the Task Hub subresource that you are using and click on the dashboard URL in the top right corner.
