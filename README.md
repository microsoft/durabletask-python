This repo contains a Python client SDK for use with the [Durable Task Framework for Go](https://github.com/microsoft/durabletask-go) and [Dapr Workflow](https://docs.dapr.io/developing-applications/building-blocks/workflow/workflow-overview/). With this SDK, you can define, schedule, and manage durable orchestrations using ordinary Python code.

⚠️ **This SDK is currently under active development and is not yet ready for production use.** ⚠️

> Note that this project is **not** currently affiliated with the [Durable Functions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/durable/durable-functions-overview) project for Azure Functions. If you are looking for a Python SDK for Durable Functions, please see [this repo](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-durable-python).

## Features

- [x] Orchestrations
- [x] Activities
- [x] Durable timers
- [x] Sub-orchestrations
- [ ] External events
- [ ] Suspend and resume
- [ ] Retry policies

## Supported patterns

The following orchestration patterns are currently supported.

### Function chaining

An orchestration can chain a sequence of function calls using the following syntax:

```python
# simple activity function that returns a greeting
def hello(ctx: task.ActivityContext, name: str) -> str:
    return f'Hello {name}!'

# orchestrator function that sequences the activity calls
def sequence(ctx: task.OrchestrationContext, _):
    result1 = yield ctx.call_activity(hello, input='Tokyo')
    result2 = yield ctx.call_activity(hello, input='Seattle')
    result3 = yield ctx.call_activity(hello, input='London')

    return [result1, result2, result3]
```

You can find the full sample [here](./examples/activity_sequence.py).

### Fan-out/fan-in

An orchestration can fan-out a dynamic number of function calls in parallel and then fan-in the results using the following syntax:

```python
# activity function for getting the list of work items
def get_work_items(ctx: task.ActivityContext, _) -> List[str]:
    # ...

# activity function for processing a single work item
def process_work_item(ctx: task.ActivityContext, item: str) -> int:
    # ...

# orchestrator function that fans-out the work items and then fans-in the results
def orchestrator(ctx: task.OrchestrationContext, _):
    # the number of work-items is unknown in advance
    work_items = yield ctx.call_activity(get_work_items)

    # fan-out: schedule the work items in parallel and wait for all of them to complete
    tasks = [ctx.call_activity(process_work_item, input=item) for item in work_items]
    results = yield task.when_all(tasks)

    # fan-in: summarize and return the results
    return {'work_items': work_items, 'results': results, 'total': sum(results)}
```

You can find the full sample [here](./examples/fanout_fanin.py).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- A Durable Task-compatible sidecar, like [Dapr Workflow](https://docs.dapr.io/developing-applications/building-blocks/workflow/workflow-overview/)

### Installing the Durable Task Python client SDK

Installation is currently only supported from source. Ensure pip, setuptools, and wheel are up-to-date.

```sh
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
```

To install this package from source, clone this repository and run the following command from the project root:

```sh
python3 -m pip install .
```

### Run the samples

See the [examples](./examples) directory for a list of sample orchestrations and instructions on how to run them.

## Development

The following is more information about how to develop this project. Note that development commands require that `make` is installed on your local machine. If you're using Windows, you can install `make` using [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) or use WSL.

### Generating protobufs

Protobuf definitions are stored in the [./submodules/durabletask-proto](./submodules/durabletask-proto) directory, which is a submodule. To update the submodule, run the following command from the project root:

```sh
git submodule update --init
```

Once the submodule is available, the corresponding source code can be regenerated using the following command from the project root:

```sh
make proto-gen
```

### Running unit tests

Unit tests can be run using the following command from the project root. Unit tests _don't_ require a sidecar process to be running.

```sh
make test-unit
```

### Running E2E tests

The E2E (end-to-end) tests require a sidecar process to be running. You can use the Dapr sidecar for this or run a Durable Task test sidecar using the following `docker` command:

```sh
docker run --name durabletask-sidecar -p 4001:4001 --env 'DURABLETASK_SIDECAR_LOGLEVEL=Debug' --rm cgillum/durabletask-sidecar:latest start --backend Emulator
```

To run the E2E tests, run the following command from the project root:

```sh
make test-e2e
```
